# byb_project
Prints hello world in Python. This task was once the cutting edge of computer technology. Now we have computers that spy on us, computers that operate in polynomial time, and computers that tell us what is moral and immoral. What a time to be alive, wouldn't you say?

This is a simple project, so just DL the .py file and run it in whichever way suites you. I use VS.
