This is a hello world project. Nothing special here.

We have computers that can think, we have computers that operate in polynomial time, we have computers that spy and gather data on us. How long until we have computers that can think in polynomial time of new ways to spy on us? That's a scary thought.
For now though, enjoy the simple things, Like a hello_world!
