This is a hello world project. Nothing special here.

I'm a cyber security trainee and aspiring SOC Analyst who also has an interest in programming.
We have computers that can think, we have computers that operate in polynomial time, we have computers that spy and gather data on us. How long until we have computers that can think in polynomial time of new ways to spy on us? That's a scary thought.
For now though, enjoy the simple things, Like a hello_world!
